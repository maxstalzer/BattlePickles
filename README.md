# BattlePickles
USER MANUAL - Here is a step-by-step walk through of the game:

1. The game's start up screen is shown there is the title of the game and only one button labelled "Start" to start a new game.
2. The game selection screen is shown, here the user can select either single or multiplayer or to go back to the start up screen.
3. After selecting either single or multiplayer the corresponding menu is shown where the user can enter a player name and set the 
AI difficulty for single player and set both names in the multiplayer case. The user can then start the game with the desired settings.
4. The placement screen comes up showing the board and a side-panel where the pickles that have not been placed are shown. 
To place a pickle the user clicks on the desired pickle in the side-panel and then clicks on the tile they want to place it. 
Before clicking the tile they can change the direction (vertical or horizontal) that the pickle is placed by pressing D on their keyboard. 
The current direction that the pickle will be placed in is shown by a label in the side-panel. 
If the game is single player the shooting screen will be shown once the user is done placing all the pickles, whereas in multiplayer the screen 
is shown again so the other player can place their pickles.
5. The shooting screen is shown, here the player's own board with their placement is on the left side and their guesses are shown on a board on the right side. As the players take turns the boards are updated with the guesses. A blue circle is used to represent a miss, a red cross for a hit and a green splatter once a pickle is "sunk". A screen comes up every time a pickle is sunk displaying a GIF animation. If a terrain tile is hit a coordinate of a tile containing a pickle is shown in the "Known Coordinates" panel. There is a button to save the current state of the game in order to be able to quit and load from it when playing another time.
6. Once a user has sunk all the other player's pickles a screen comes up announcing the winner and allowing the user to go back to the start menu.
